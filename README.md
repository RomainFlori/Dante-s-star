The goal of this project is to create a perfect and imperfect maze and to solve it in C.

The generator is random, that's more interesting ^^

## Perfect and Imperfect maze ?
*Perfect = only one exit possible*
*Imperfect = many solutions*

## How to run it
- Clone this repository
- Use ``make`` into the folder
- Run ./generator x y (perfect)
- Example perfect maze  : ./generator 15 10 perfect
- Example imperfect maze : ./generator 15 10

## How the mazes look like:
*Imperfect*
